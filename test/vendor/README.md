# Vendored CommonMark spec

- `spec.txt` is the CommonMark 0.31.2 specification, fetched verbatim from
  https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/blob/0.31.2/spec.txt.
- `spec.json` is the embedded example suite (652 markdown/HTML pairs) extracted
  from `spec.txt` by `scripts/extract_spec.pl`, reproducing the schema that
  upstream's `test/spec_tests.py --dump-tests` produces. Re-run the script
  after vendoring a newer `spec.txt` to refresh it.
